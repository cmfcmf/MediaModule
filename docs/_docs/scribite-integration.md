excerpt: "The Media Module integrates well with Scribite's CKEditor. Learn how to configure and enable this integration in this entry."

First, make sure Scribite is installed and configured to use the CKEditor. Other editors are 
currently not supported. Then, head over to the CKEditor settings inside of Scribite and make
sure to use the _full_ or _special_ toolbar. Otherwise, the "Insert media / collections" button
will not appear.

If you configured everything correctly, a new button will be added to Scribite's toolbar. If you
click it, you can choose to upload new media, embed media from the web or embed existing media.
