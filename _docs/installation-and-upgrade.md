## Installation

1. **Download the module from https://github.com/zikula-modules/MediaModule/releases/latest.**
2. Extract it to `src/extensions/cmfcmf/media-module` (so that the `media-module` folder contains 
   all the files).
3. Install it from the Extensions Module.

**Downloading directly from master would require you to execute `composer install --no-dev`.**

## Upgrade

An automatic module upgrader is in place. You'll be notified whenever there is a new version 
available. If you decide to install a new version, it will be downloaded and upgraded automatically
for you.
